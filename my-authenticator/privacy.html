        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This privacy policy applies to all information collected by the My Authenticator mobile application.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            The My Authenticator application processes two-factor credentials entered by the user and stores them locally and securely in the iOS Keychain. User preferences related to the display of data within the app are also stored locally on your device. The application never connects to the internet, and never sends any information to the developers, or to any other app, server, or third party of any kind.
        </p>

        <h2>We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            We do not use your data or any information about your usage of the app in any way.
        </p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
            As the application is designed to transmit no information, no information is knowingly collected from or about any children.
        </p>

        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>
            No analytics information is collected by the application. No third-party analytics functionality is included in the application.
        <p>
            Depending on your iOS system settings, Apple may collect analytics information about your usage of the application and information related to any application crashes, and may share an anonymized subset of that information with the developer to help improve the application. You can learn more about iOS App Analytics in the iOS Settings app, under the headings "Privacy" > "Analytics", and you can view Apple's privacy policy at <a href="https://apple.com/privacy">https://apple.com/privacy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
        <p>
            By using the My Authenticator application, you consent to this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            From time to time we may make changes to this privacy policy, and any updates will be posted to this web page.
        </p>
